      int + int => addition  | sum
      10 + 20  => 30

      str + str => str | concatenation
      "sai" + "baba" => saibaba

      Typecasting
          Process of converting the value from one type
          to another type.Basically type casting is classified
          into 2 types
          
               1.Implicit Typecasting
               2.Explicit Typecasting

    Implicit Typecasting is the process of converting
    the value from one type to another type, by the
    System automatically

    Where as Explicit typecasting is the process of
    converting the value from one type to anoter
    by us manually.

    Python support explicit typecasting
        In the Python for every Data type there is function
        is provided
             int     ->     int( )
             float  ->    float( )
             complex -> complex( )
             str -> str( )
             bool -> bool( )
             list -> list( )
             tuple -> tuple( )
             dict -> dict( ).....
