   - Data types

         In Python Data types are classified into 3 types
             1.value types
                   - can store a value.

                   number : int | float | complex                       
                   non number types : bool | None
                   
             2.collection types
                   - can store group of values
                   - collections also known as iterable
                     sequences | predefined Data structures
                          Eg:  list | tuple | set | str | dict ...
             
             3.Binary types
                   - Mostly used for media related stuff.
                   - like : images, AF ,VF,objects
                        Eg:  bytes | bytearray
                        
Note: In Python Every data type is a class
    Eg:  int    ->    <class 'int'>
           float  ->   <class 'float'>

IQ: Every class is a datatype or not ?
Ans : Yes.

Note
1.In Python Every thing will be stored in the form of
an object [ Object is nothingbut instance of class ]

2.In Python objects are dynamic in size i.e there is
no fixed range and fixed sizes.

3.Objects are classified into 2 types
        1.mutable objects
              Mutable objects are one which enable you
              to make the changes in the content of
              same object.
              
        2.immutable objects
             immutable objects are one which doesn't allows
             to make the changes in the content of the same
             object, rather it will create new object with
             modified content
                 Eg:  int | float | complex | str | tuple | bool
