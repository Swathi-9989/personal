'''
   bitwise operators are used
       perform the operations only on
           binary digits [bits] and it will
           return result in the form of decimal values.           

   x=10 => 1 0 1 0
   y=11 => 1 0 1 1
    
  bitwise operators are
     bitwise and  (&)
         - It will work same as logical and
         - 1-True   | 0 -False

    x=10 => 1 0 1 0
    y=11 => 1 0 1 1
    =============
    x&y   => 1 0 1 0 => 10
    print(x&y)
          
     bitwise or (|)
         - It will work same as logical or
         - 1-True | 0-False

    x=10 => 1 0 1 0
    y=11 => 1 0 1 1
    =============
    x|y    =>  1 0 1 1 => 11
    print(x|y)
   
     bitwise xor ^
         - It will return 1 if both bits are different else 0         

      x=10 => 1 0 1 0
      y=11 => 1 0 1 1
      =============
      x^y   => 0 0 0  1  => 1
      print(x^y)    
         
     bitwise left shift    <<
     bitwise right shift >>
