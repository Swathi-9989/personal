class and object
   what is class ?
       - class is the keyword

       - using the class keyword,
          we can define our own data type called
          user defined datatype.
          
       - in the class we can declare variables called
         fields [which are used to hold the data]

       - in the class we can define the functions called
         methods [ which are used to manipulate the data]

       - we can define the class empty
       - we can define the class only with fields
       - we can define the class only with methods
       - we can also define the class with both
                   fields and methods

        Syn:
            <class>   <className>:
                Declare variables
                     Fields
                             or
                Define the functions
                         Methods

      Eg:  class Test:  [User defined DT]
                   pass
