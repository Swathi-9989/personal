SET Vs FROZENSET

set and frozenset almost work both are same
Except one difference i.e set is mutable collection
where as frozenset is immutable collection.

> we can define the set by using set( ) or set(iterable)
> we can define the frozenset by using frozenset( )
   or frozenset(iterable)

> All the methods for set are legal to use in the frozenset
except update related methods
